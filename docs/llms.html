    <h1>FastHTML</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>FastHTML is a python library which brings together Starlette, Uvicorn, HTMX, and fastcore's <code>FT</code> "FastTags" into a library for creating server-rendered hypermedia applications. The <code>FastHTML</code> class itself inherits from <code>Starlette</code>, and adds decorator-based routing with many additions, Beforeware, automatic <code>FT</code> to HTML rendering, and much more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Things to remember when writing FastHTML apps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Although parts of its API are inspired by FastAPI, it is <em>not</em> compatible with FastAPI syntax and is not targeted at creating API services</li>
<li>FastHTML includes support for Pico CSS and the fastlite sqlite library, although using both are optional; sqlalchemy can be used directly or via the fastsql library, and any CSS framework can be used. Support for the Surreal and css-scope-inline libraries are also included, but both are optional</li>
<li>FastHTML is compatible with JS-native web components and any vanilla JS library, but not with React, Vue, or Svelte</li>
<li>Use <code>serve()</code> for running uvicorn (<code>if __name__ == "__main__"</code> is not needed since it's automatic)</li>
<li>When a title is needed with a response, use <code>Titled</code>; note that that already wraps children in <code>Container</code>, and already includes both the meta title as well as the H1 element.</li>
</ul>
